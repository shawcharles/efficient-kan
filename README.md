# An Efficient Implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (Fork)

**Note:** This repository is a fork of an efficient implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), adapted and utilized for the analysis presented in:
*   Shaw, C. (2025). Nuisance Function Estimation in the DML Framework: A Tale of Two Models. arXiv preprint.
*   Shaw, C. (2025). Efficient Estimation of Distributional Treatment Effects with Endogenous Treatments: A Machine Learning Approach. arXiv preprint.

The original `efficient-kan` library (on which this fork is based) can be found at [https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan](https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan) (by @Blealtan). The original KAN implementation (`pykan`) is available [here](https://github.com/KindXiaoming/pykan).
